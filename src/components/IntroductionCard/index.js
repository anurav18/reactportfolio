 I am a SharePoint Developer who has immense interest in customizing the look and feel of the SharePoint Sites. 
          In order to achieve this, I need to have the skill of using several web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and many more, 
          with the rapid increase in the demand for responsive web pages, I was always interested to pursue my career as a UI developer. I believe that 
          I have a creative brain and feel like I should convert this aspect of mine into a Career path. 
          I have done my Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Kakatiya University, India and I have completed my masterâ€™s in electrical 
          engineering from Northern Illinois University, Illinois. As an Electrical Engineering Student, I never really got a chance to get my hands dirty by 
          trying to code something. As an Electrical Engineering Student, I never

        I have been trying for some platform which will help me fulfill my dream, one day I came across this Bootcamp which is conducted by University of
        Washington which has the teaching of all latest technologies which are in-demand on the market. At the end of this course, I feel that I will be
        confident enough to build a website from scratch which is responsive and has the latest features included in React. I am very much excited to be 
        a part of this program and really looking forward to enhancing my skills.
